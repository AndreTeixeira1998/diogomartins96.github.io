# Making your own CV
It's really easy to make your own GitHub hosted page:

1. Create a repository named *username.github.io* where *username* is your Github user.
2. Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
3. Add an `index.html` file
```
cd username.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
```
4. Push it and Commit
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```
5. Welcome to your **https://*username*.github.io**

Now it's time for work! :construction_worker:
